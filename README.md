Retail Sales Forecasting Dashboard
An interactive dashboard for forecasting future weekly sales using a machine learning model built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

This project demonstrates how a trained model can be used to predict future sales, helping businesses with inventory and supply chain management.

Project Description
Retailers lose money every year due to understocking (lost sales) or overstocking (wasted inventory). This project aims to forecast weekly sales to help optimize inventory levels.

Key features:

Forecast sales using a Random Forest Regressor (or other ML models).

Interactive Streamlit app for filtering by store and department.

Historical analysis with visualizations showing actual vs. predicted sales.

Iterative forecasting to predict a multi-step future sales trend.

Handles various features including time-based data, lags, and rolling averages.

Dataset
Source: A public dataset of historical weekly sales for 45 Walmart stores over a period of time.

Features:

Store: The store ID.

Date: The week of the sale.

Weekly_Sales: The total sales for that week (the target variable).

Other features: Information on Holiday_Flag, Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, Unemployment, and engineered features like sales_lag_1, rolling_mean_4w, etc.

Model Accuracy
The project uses a Random Forest Regressor trained on the Walmart sales dataset.

Evaluation Metrics (for regression):

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): A measure of the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the average of squared errors.

R-squared (RÂ²): The proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).
